# First Program in Python

This is my first python program created while studying online book **The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python!**

## What did I learn so far

I leared about pip, pipenv and how to install python packages using pipenv command

When we install any package using pipenv, it also generates two special files:
 > - Pipfile
 > - Pipfile.lock

 These are similar to package.json and package.lock.json files that are generated when we import libraries in reactjs

 ## What does this program do

This program simply prints users's IP address using requests module/package of Python
